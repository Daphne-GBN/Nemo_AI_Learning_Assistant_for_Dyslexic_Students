## Nemo – AI Learning Assistant for Dyslexic Students

DP Nemo is an AI-powered accessibility chatbot designed to support students with dyslexia by providing simplified, conversational, and structured learning assistance.
It combines Rasa (NLU & dialogue management), a Flask backend, and a lightweight frontend UI to deliver an interactive learning experience.

This project focuses on clarity, reduced cognitive load, and accessibility-first design.

## Project Objectives

Assist dyslexic students with easy-to-understand explanations

Reduce reading overload using short, structured responses

Enable conversational learning instead of static content

Build a modular, scalable AI system suitable for academic deployment

## System Architecture (High Level)
